# An intro repo to HCL

In this repo you will find:
* a simple example of a working hcl decode project
* a presentation going through it

## To run the presentation:

```shell-session
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
present
```
And open that link.

If go is complaining, you might have to run present with `GO111MODULE=off` set.

The presentation.pdf file will work just fine !

## To run the example

```
go run .
```
